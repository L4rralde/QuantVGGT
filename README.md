## Updates

- [October 10, 2025] Evaluation code for reproducing our camera pose estimation results on Co3D is now available.

## Quick Start

First, clone this repository to your local machine, and install the dependencies (torch, torchvision, numpy, Pillow, and huggingface_hub).

```
git clone git@github.com:wlfeng0509/QuantVGGT.git
cd QuantVGGT
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then download the pre trained weights provided by [VGGT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt) and prepare Co3D dataset following [this](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt/tree/evaluation/evaluation).

Then download the pre trained W4A4 quantization parameters from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/wlfeng/QuantVGGT/tree/main) and place the downloaded folder under *evaluation\outputs\w4a4* branch.

We can now use the provided script for inference **(remember to change the data path within the script)**.

```
cd evaluation
bash test.sh
```

Also, you can use the quantized model for predicting other 3D attributes following the guidance [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt/tree/evaluation#detailed-usage).

## Comments

* Our codebase is heavily builds on [VGGT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt) and [QuaRot](https://github.com/spcl/QuaRot). Thanks for open-sourcing!
